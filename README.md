# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Week 4 Programming Assignment

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at,
 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository'(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

# Scope of the program
# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. From the data set in Step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
